                <h3> Harry James Potter</h3>
                <p>Harry James Potter (b. 31 July 1980) was an English half-blood wizard, and one of the most 
                    famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter,
                     Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as 
                     the one with the power to vanquish his arch-enemy, Lord Voldemort, one of the most powerful 
                     and feared Dark wizards in the world. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, 
                     courtesy of Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. 
                     This in turn caused the Potter family to go into hiding.</p>
